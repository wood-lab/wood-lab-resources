## R Markdown
  
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.  
  
I recommend starting all R Markdown documents with a setup chunk that includes:  
* All libraries you need to load  
* Any knitr options (knitr::opts_chunk) you'd like to use  
* Load any RData, csv, or other files used in analysis  
* Colors to be used throughout the analysis   

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(vegan)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)

# Set options
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) # This ensures that the default for all chunks is to print both the code and the results (more on that below)

# Load necessary data
load("../../Documents/Data_Analysis/KI_Platy/data/KI_seqs_f_coral_grouped.RData")

# Set colors for plotting
sitecolors <- c("#762a83", "#9970ab", "#c2a5cf", "#a6dba0", "#5aae61", "#1b7837")
taxcolors <- matrix(c("#d9d9d9", "#ffffb3", "#fb8072"),
                    dimnames=list(c("CladeA", "CladeC", "CladeD")))
```
  
I find that this is helpful for keeping your code and overall document clean and easy to read.  
  
  
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
  
## Some thoughts about `setwd()`  
I generally recommend against using `setwd()` in any code. Here's why:  
* If you use RProjects, you can open your RProject, and it sets your working directory for you (to the folder the RProject is located in). So, no need to bother.  
* This is also **extremely helpful** for collaborations, because collaborators don't have to change your `setwd()` code to work on their computer. It just automatically works when they open the RProject.  
  
  
## Including Plots
  
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure) # This is a plot of pressure across a range of temperatures
```
  
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. `echo = TRUE` prints both the R code and any output generated by that code.  
  
`include = FALSE` will run the code, but will not include the code or the results in the knitted document.  

`cache = TRUE` will cache the results of that particular chunk, and the next time you knit, will only re-run that chunk if the code within that chunk has changed. This is particularly useful for computationally heavy models, etc. that you might not want to wait for every time you knit.  
  
## Code Readability
For information about how to format an RMarkdown document, see https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html  
  
As in R scripts, you can use a newline (enter) after a comma in your code for readability
```{r pressure2, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure, pch = 12, col = "blue", 
     cex.axis = 1.2, cex.lab = 1.5, # You can add comments here too
     ylab = "Pressure", xlab = "Temperature")
```
